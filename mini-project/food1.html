      Bulalo is a classic Filipino beef soup made with shanks and bone marrow.
      It is slow-cooked until the meat is tender and the broth is full of flavor.
      Often served with corn, cabbage, and potatoes, this dish is loved during
      cold or rainy days. In Las Piñas, several eateries are known for their
      special version of Bulalo, making it a must-try dish when visiting the city.
